DJ worked on Page I1, I2, I3, I4, and I5 and Joshua worked on Page B1, B2, S1 and Selenium tests. DJ and Joshua were able to meet all of the project criteria with simple user interface, as users can add actor, director, movie information, comments to movies, and relations between actors / directors and movies, a page that shows actor information, a page that shows movie information, and a page that lets users search anything through a keyword.
As a team, DJ and Joshua didn't have a lot of problems while working on the project as DJ's part and Joshua's part were merged and worked flawlessly.
